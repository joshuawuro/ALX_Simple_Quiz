    For this week's milestone, focusing on the fundamentals of JavaScript, you will apply what you've learned by building a simple, interactive webpage.

    This project will incorporate JavaScript syntax, control structures, basic functions, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

    You'll be tasked with creating two features for this webpage: a basic quiz application and a simple calculator.
